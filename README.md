The first step is to annotate the images of the different classes, to do that with bounding boxex and convert the annotation in the Yolo format

# Step 1:
Download LabelImg, it is a tool that label your images by drawing bounding boxes around the objects and assigning them to the correct class and this will save the  annotations in YOLO format i.e. in the txt format

# Step 2:
Mange your dataset direcotry it is already in the proper format

# Step 3:
